Overall, the model performed quite well: it correctly predicted the outcome in all four cases. The vote-level accuracy was 67 percent (69 percent if you count Barrett’s <u>Bowe</u> vote differently). It’s a small sample, so time will tell, but that’s better than expected at the case level and slightly worse than expected at the vote level.

Also notable, of the twelve incorrectly predicted votes, the model acknowledged nine as sufficiently uncertain that they could have gone the other way. Estimates of uncertainty were designed to capture the correct result 90 percent of the time. So far, 8 percent (3/36) of estimates failed that test—i.e., they were confident errors. So again, in line with expected parameters based on validation runs.

<a href="https://reasonablemachines.io/posts/post-docket-report-bowe-v-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="post-link">Bowe v. United States</a>. (Repeat habeas claims.) The Court reversed/remanded 5-4, with dissenting votes by Gorsuch, Thomas, Alito, and Barrett (in part). The model predicted the Court would reverse 7-2, with dissents by Alito and Roberts. The Roberts dissent was estimated to be uncertain, as were the predicted reverse votes by Thomas and Barrett.

<a href="https://reasonablemachines.io/posts/post-docket-report-barrett-v-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="post-link">Barrett v. United States</a>. (Double jeopardy.) The Court reversed, 9-0, with a concurring opinion by Gorsuch. The model predicted the Court would reverse 7-2, with dissents by Alito and Kavanaugh.

<a href="https://reasonablemachines.io/posts/post-docket-report-case-v-montana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="post-link">Case v. Montana</a>. (Emergency aid entry without a warrant.) The Court affirmed 9-0, with concurring opinions by Sotomayor and Gorsuch. The model predicted the Court would affirm 5-4. Three of the predicted dissents, however, were uncertain (Kagan, Barrett, Jackson).
