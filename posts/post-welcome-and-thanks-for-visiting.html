A little about me -- I am a professor at Cornell, where I teach and research in public law and quantitative methods. Most of my recent work involves language models and jurisprudence, and I will post more about that soon. I am also especially interested in administrative law, or the law that governs the actions and interpretations of administrative agencies. I will post about that, too.

Does the world need another website? Perhaps not. But let me explain why I decided to start this. Like many others who publish online, I wanted a more informal and experimental place to consider ideas, data, models, and the like. It’s possible some of these ideas turn into full papers. But most will not. Also like many others, I feel let down and turned off by social media. So this log is also a throwback; an effort to turn back the clock to a more deliberative version of the web. 

The final reason to start this log is that I am excited by the developments in language models and AI and their possible uses in the legal space. I’ve long been interested in NLP, but earlier models were much less powerful and, I felt, sensitive to small changes in parameter choices. The new language models tend to be more powerful and robust, and I am excited about what can be learned through their use. 

That’s it for now—until soon.</div>
